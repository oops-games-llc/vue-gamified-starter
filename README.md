# Vue Gamified Auth Starter

A premium, production-ready Vue 3 boilerplate featuring the best alternative to Google reCAPTCHA. Built for Vue and Vite developers who want to skip the setup and start building high-conversion authentication flows.

## Features
- **Vue 3 + Vite** SPA Architecture (Composition API)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** Glassmorphism UI
- **Gamified CAPTCHA Built-In**: The most robust, WCAG-compliant bot protection available. Stop losing signups to blurry crosswalks.
- **Firebase Auth Ready**: Pre-configured for Email/Password registration.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

By default, the template runs in a **Graceful Fallback Mode**. You can test the UI, the gamified CAPTCHA, and the mock dashboard instantly without configuring any database keys.

## Production Deployment

To protect your production application from automated spam, you must generate a free production API key:

1. Visit [Conversion.Business](https://conversion.business)
2. Get your free `VITE_CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
3. Add it to your `.env` file

*Note: The system explicitly disables Mock Mode in production and throws a hard configuration error. It fails securely.*
